        <li>The social status of women in the developing countries may be placed in the spotlight so that the maternal health issues can gain global attention and attain contribution to solve the problem</li>
		<li>A study of the Cameroonian women revealed that even though the women were worried about their health especially when they are pregnant, they chose to blind themselves from recognizing and protecting their right to achieving good health care due to their cultural background of the gender roles </li>
        <li>While the bracelet successfully produced and invented, this is an indirect manner to tell the men in the developing country that good health care is vital and important for pregnant women as they have the right and have the same status as men.</li>
        <li>Although the application of the bracelet may not be able to reduce the maternal death rate to zero, it is possible that it can be reduced to the lowest rate.</li>

        <li>A new-born brings joy and happiness but more than 3 million babies die every year in their first month of life in Africa (Lawn, Mongi & Cousens, 2006). </li>
		<li>According to United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), at least 20% of children under age of 5 who suffering disease usually caused by the problem of maternal health, malnutrition during pregnancy, quality of giving birth and the new-born period is also very important for the child (Ot√°vio Clark, 2016). </li>
        <li>Children whose mother had died during giving birth and have maternal health problem are more difficult to survive</li>
        <li>Mother is very important for the growing process of children. </li>

        <li>It will increase the opportunity of women in developing country to get the education about reproduction, fertility, birth control</li>
        <li>This can help them to prevent unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortion and sexually transmitted diseases (STD) which are HIV or AIDS.</li>
        <li>Despite the living environment concern, postpartum monitoring and cleanliness are very important for maternal health.</li>
		<li>Those who live far from the medical center can learn more about the method of good personal hygiene and the postpartum attention to decrease the risk of infection with the help of the bracelet.</li>
		<li>Besides that, education also can change the status of women in a traditional family (Unite For Sight, 2018). </li>
		<li>Educated women have more chances and power to make their own decision in a birth plan and are more concern about modern medical resources.</li>
