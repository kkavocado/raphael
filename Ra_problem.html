    <p><h1>Do you know that there are approximately 830 women who die during pregnancy and childbirth every day due to some causes that can be prevented?</h1><br/>
	   <h2>Can you imagine how high is the risk for a mother to give birth? </h2>
	    <p class="raphael-problem-text">
                The risk of the mother of developing country dying in the pregnancy-related causes 
				is approximately 36 times compared to the woman of the developed country.
				Let's take Sierra Leone as an example :
				
				<h3>Sierra Leone</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>poverty country</li>
				<li>high Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) of 1,165 deaths per 100,000 live births</li>
