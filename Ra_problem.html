    <p><h1>Approximately 830 women die during pregnancy and childbirth every day due to some causes that can be prevented!</h1><br/>
	    <p class="raphael-problem-text">
                The risk of the mother of developing country dying in the pregnancy-related causes 
				is approximately 36 times compared to the woman of the developed country.
				Let's take Sierra Leone as an example :
				
				<h3>Sierra Leone</h3>
				<ul>
				<li>poverty country</li>
				<li>high Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) of 1,165 deaths per 100,000 live births</li>
              </p>

	<p class "discription">From the pie chart above, it is shown that maternal mortality during pregnancy and after 
	delivery occupies a large proportion in Sierra Leone. </p>

<p><h1>Long Distance to the Hospital is the PROBLEM.</h1>
	<p class="raphael-distance">
			Most rural villages are only accessible by off-road vehicles or motorbikes due to the poor 
			road conditions, especially in the rainy season.
			The distance to the hospital as well as lack of accessible and affordable vehicles were significant
			barriers when attempting to go to the hospital to deliver. Many women were reluctant to walk so far; 
			did not want to walk alone; and were fearful of giving birth along the bush road, a situation that many 
			had already experienced.
