	    <p class="raphael-problem-text">
		The risk of the mother of developing country dying in the pregnancy-related causes 
		is approximately <b>36</b> times compared to the woman of the developed country.
				<p>Let's take <a href= "https://www.britannica.com/place/Sierra-Leone">Sierra Leone</a> as an example :</p>

	<p class="mainProblem" ><h2>Long Distance to the Hospital is the <b>PROBLEM</b>.</h2></p>
	<p class="raphael-distance">
			Most rural villages are only accessible by off-road vehicles or motorbikes due to the poor 
			road conditions, especially in the rainy season.
			The distance to the hospital as well as lack of accessible and affordable vehicles were significant
			barriers when attempting to go to the hospital to deliver. 
			<p>Many women were reluctant to walk so far; 
			did not want to walk alone; and were fearful of giving birth along the bush road, a situation that many 
			had already experienced. </p>
	</p>
</div>

<h5>One woman shared her experience of trying to get to the hospital along the bush road: </h5>
<p><q id="a">“(…) as soon as I felt the labour pain I decided to go to the hospital to deliver there. But since I started 
to give birth, I have never been to the hospital yet, although I have (had) the plan to go there. I have given birth to 
3 children along the bush road when I was going to Masanga Hospital.” (IDI 22)</q></p>
